"""
This is a list of all of the defined Formalizer components that can be called as
executables.

For general information about the Formalizer environment, use the fzinfo tool.
For information specific to a particular component, call the executable with
the "-h" option or see the Formalizer documentation.

This list differs from the one in the root Makefile in that it contains only
the executable call names of the executable components. The list in the Makefile
expands to the full paths to those components.
