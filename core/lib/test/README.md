## Formalizer:Core:Library: Unit Tests

Unit tests for library (class member) functions with required behavior.

### Building and running tests

There are two ways to build the tests:

1. From the parent directory (`../`), run `make test`.

2. From this directory, run `make`.

To run all tests:

```
./test
```

To run a specific test:

```
./test <name-of-test>
```

To see all possible tests:

```
./test -h
```

### Note

*This is not yet populated, but it will probably use a Unit Test method such as Catch2.*
