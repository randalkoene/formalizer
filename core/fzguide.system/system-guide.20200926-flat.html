<!-- FZGUIDE -->

A few notes:
- DO NOT force yourself to stick with the chapter/section/subsection/index divisions that seem to be in the previous HTML version.
- Simply apply sane divisions. Clearly, the whole thing is System Guide. Clearly, a big chunk is in the AM chapter, and another in the PM chapter.
- You can come up with additional chapters if you like.
- You don't have to call the whole AM metrics batch "Morning Metrics". You can apply additional section headers if you like.
- Where the previous version had several big cells per subsection, you can assign major and minor subsection numbers to those.
- And then you can use whole index numbers for points within those cells, leaving the decimals for later insertions.

Activity: At the very start of the day's tasks:<br />
<b>(If possible, use the <u>system-action-start.sh</u> script for activity insights.)</b>
<!-- ID={act:01.1:02.1:Decisions and Challenges:01.1} -->
Acknowledge the Decision Nodes at the top of the day's schedule. Quickly dive into each, turning on Supervisor mode to make a quick decision and do it. Base the decision on what the <b>bravest</b> person would do, and immediately do that.<br />
The hard-part Decision and action that completes the Node at that stage does not always need to be a full solution of a problem. The Challenge was to take it up and engage, not to completely solve - since that can sometimes be a protracted process with many stages. Oftentimes, perhaps almost always, the Decision that completes the Node is a start of, or the next step in, a conversation, a conversation where you went ahead and put the ball into another party's court.
<!-- ID={act:01.1:02.1:Decisions and Challenges:02.1} -->
Acknowledge the subset of Nodes near the top of the day's schedule that are Challenges to dive into.
<!-- ID={act:01.1:02.1:Decisions and Challenges:03.1} -->
Do micro-meditation as per instructions.
<!-- ID={act:01.1:02.1:Decisions and Challenges:04.1} -->
Do a round on the Challenges. Each receives about 10 minutes. You are <b>not trying to solve each one</b>. You are just trying to <b>engage</b> with each. During quick engagement:
<ol>
    <li>Write down what you want coming out of it. Add this to a template you can use for working on a Challenge.</li>
    <li>Write a 2-line first bit of conversation (draft) that you could send to someone you should be talking with, based on what you want. Add this to the template too.</li>
    <li>If needed, list the small component parts of the Challenge. Again, use the template for this. In this part of the template, you are using language that offers a perspective that steers away from unnecessary difficulty-, anxiety- or risk-emphasizing.</li>
    <li>Use the available checkmarks to designate the pieces easy or hard.</li>
    <li>The Node on the day's schedule now represents the easy part. You can make a new Node for the hard part.</li>
</ol>
<!-- ID={act:01.1:02.1:Decisions and Challenges:05.1} -->
Dive into the discovered easy parts of each Challenge that is already on the day's schedule and do that. (The hard part will have become a Decision, probably scheduled tomorrow.)
