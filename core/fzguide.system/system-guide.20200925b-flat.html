<!-- FZGUIDE -->
A few notes:
- DO NOT force yourself to stick with the chapter/section/subsection/index divisions that seem to be in the previous HTML version.
- Simply apply sane divisions. Clearly, the whole thing is System Guide. Clearly, a big chunk is in the AM chapter, and another in the PM chapter.
- You can come up with additional chapters if you like.
- You don't have to call the whole AM metrics batch "Morning Metrics". You can apply additional section headers if you like.
- Where the previous version had several big cells per subsection, you can assign major and minor subsection numbers to those.
- And then you can use whole index numbers for points within those cells, leaving the decimals for later insertions.

If the graphs are not displaying data points for the most recent day(s) then the data range needs to be extended. Unhide hidden columns, scroll to the bottom, and copy-paste the last row to several more new rows (enough to reach up to and slightly beyond the current date). Then hide the columns '16-Intentions', 'Meaningful IntPriority', '16-Progress', '2x progress', '3x Challenge steps', and '3x Criteria steps'. The graphs should automatically update to show new data. If the graphs are getting too hard to read then you might want to edit them to start showing data from a later date.

If the 'Estimated Date at next Milestone' is a divide by 0 error then there just hasn’t been enough meaningful progress along the Path in the last 7 days to make a useful projection.

<font color="#ff0000">Right now, the System has a negative slant / punishing slant, in that the best one can achieve is 100%, and the struggle is always about not performing too low. The point winning approach would be somewhat different that way. I would be collecting points, always working up. There wouldn't need to be a predefined upper limit.</font>

Milestone advancing tasks were scheduled in accordance with their priority proportions for Active Milestones. (Those proportions can also be taken care of through clustering within Blocks that appear at frequencies proportional to priority.)
<p><b>If it wasn't done in yesterday's main AL update:</b> Within a time window that extends both into the past and the future (e.g. 3 days into the past, 3 days into the future), collect all of the Milestone-associated Progress earning tasks (whether in blocks or not), calculate the proportions of each and compare with the relative priorities.
