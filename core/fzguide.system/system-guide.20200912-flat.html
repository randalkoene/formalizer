Legend:
A table cell with <span style="background: #96e6e6">light cyan background</span>&nbsp;means that there is a
specific DIL entry, a Task to start for this.
[<span style="background: #00ff00">a</span>] means the step is probably completely automatable, even if it
requires that tasks are furnished with additional information about them.
[<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>] means the step is probably partially automatable.

Getting Started Early and Fast
<!-- ID={am:01.1:02.1:wakeup:01.1} -->
Optionally, immediately do the morning shower, etc, and some simple exercises.
<!-- ID={am:01.1:02.1:wakeup:02.1} -->
Get set up with some coffee.
<!-- ID={am:01.1:03.1:catchup:01.1} -->
Catch up the Task Log. Having updated the Task Log, it becomes possible to properly update metrics up to this time.
<p></p>
If it’s quite a bit (i.e. not just the sleep task) then assign a specific bit of time (a Task Chunk) to the ‘Catching up the Task Log’ task.
<!-- ID={am:02.1:01.1:SEC:01.1} -->
Morning Metrics
<!-- ID={am:02.1:02.1:calendar:01.1} -->
Start the Morning Metrics update by checking the Google Calendar to make sure no early appointment will be missed.
Confirm that appointments in the Calendar are in the AL.
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:01.1} -->
Do a simple quick AL update. (Aim to quickly get started with AL tasks.) The main AL updating task is in the evening due to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xU4o8GEFaCtPP2iApUDJej4dnOiAOSheYU1iUc6enkE/edit%23bookmark%3Did.k6o8907xfxdg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1584744607767000">
RTT S.Y.13</a>.
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:02.1} -->
Update the AL (dil2al -AcS0).
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:03.1} -->
In the AL CTR (~/doc/html/lists/active-list.all.ctr.html): [<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>]
Turn every task before the current time that is not a periodic task, <font color="#0000ff">has a fixed target date, and that was not completed</font>, into a variable target date task if that is possible. If it isn’t, then give such
tasks new fixed target dates.
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:04.1} -->
If you made such changes then update the AL again (dil2al -AcS0).
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:05.1} -->
Decide if you carefully <font color="#0000ff">update each periodic task</font>&nbsp;that was not completed, or if you can use the Update Unlimited Periodic Task Target Dates button at the top of the form. Do what you decided
to do, and as needed.
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:06.1} -->
If you made changes there then update the AL again (dil2al -AcS0).
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:07.1} -->
Use the Update button at the bottom of the form to <font color="#0000ff">update the variable target date tasks</font>.
If you did that then update the AL again (dil2al -AcS0).
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:08.1} -->
Make the AL realistic</font>, if this wasn’t already prepared during a main AL update the preceding day:
Update Time Required. If there are tasks in the day’s AL for which it is clear that the indicated Time Required is not a fair estimate then update that to a better estimate. [<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>]
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:09.1} -->
If there are clearly going to be activities in the day’s AL that are not included as Tasks then add those.
(For example, do not pretend that socializing or relaxing time is unnecessary, and don’t forget about travel times.)
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:10.1} -->
Now make sure that, <b>particularly among variable target date tasks</b>, <font color="#0000ff">priority tasks for the day are sorted correctly</font>, such that:
The most interesting, most likely to work out and be relevant at this moment in time are up front. Lower priority tasks should appear at times later in the day than the important tasks. [<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>]
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:11.1} -->
Also, see to it that more non-sleeping time is given to important (e.g. income earning) tasks than to other tasks.
Shift the others as necessary. [<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>]
<!-- ID={am:02.1:03.1:AL_update:12.1} -->
Where possible, try to include one or more tasks that carry out one or more Criteria steps toward the next Checkpoint or Milestone, i.e. <font color="#0000ff">Checkpoint or Milestone Criteria Steps (CMCS)</font>.
[<span style="background: #ffff00">p</span>]
<!-- ID={am:03.1:01.1:SEC:01.1} -->
Check LVL3
