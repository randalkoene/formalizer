Check LVL3

A few notes:
- DO NOT force yourself to stick with the chapter/section/subsection/index divisions that seem to be in the previous HTML version.
- Simply apply sane divisions. Clearly, the whole thing is System Guide. Clearly, a big chunk is in the AM chapter, and another in the PM chapter.
- You can come up with additional chapters if you like.
- You don't have to call the whole AM metrics batch "Morning Metrics". You can apply additional section headers if you like.
- Where the previous version had several big cells per subsection, you can assign major and minor subsection numbers to those.
- And then you can use whole index numbers for points within those cells, leaving the decimals for later insertions.

Quickly check if any Nodes immediately point out Challenges (that have not yet been identified). Challenges are identifies as being more than just a Decision. Decisions do belong at the top of the schedule. Challenges belong early in the day. Challenges will eventually probably involve a decision, but they first need a bit of work to figure out how to deal with them. (You can collect more identifiers of Challenges as you learn to identify them over the next days.)
<!-- ID={am:03.1:03.1:Challenges:02.1} -->
Create a new Node for each Challenge as needed.
<!-- ID={am:03.1:03.1:Challenges:03.1} -->

<font color="#0000ff">Yesterday was a day well spent</font>: In general, 'well spent' refers to either spending time in direct alignment with your Values (like in an Ideal Situation), or making progress on your Personal Roadmap. All time, all days, spent with fears on my mind, i.e. days spent with Escapist tendencies, feel wrong and wasted, with the wish to do them over. So, all days like that should also be noted as such. If it’s hard to determine whether, overall, the day was well spent or not well spent, then the best parameter value may be 'neutral'.

<font color="#0000ff">Waking up enthused about what I’ll be doing today</font>: You really felt immediately enthusiastic, looking forward to what you know is coming up. A ‘no’ implies some level of dread or dislike for what is coming up. Pick ‘neutral’ if neither applies.

<font color="#0000ff">Yesterday, did I limit my entertainment video watching well?</font>: Unlike the Violations in Time Tracking, this does not apply specifically to Youtube, but to all video entertainment. It is specifically meant to curb and temper movie or series watching habits. It is okay to occasionally do such things as part of solo or socializing entertainment. The limit is therefore applied as follows: Either, no more than 1 hour per day, or no more than one movie as long as you didn’t spend time like this the previous day (thereby averaging it out to no more than 1 hour per day). Cumulative Youtube watching counts the same way. If necessary, this same test may be applied to computer gaming.

<font color="#0000ff">Yesterday, was I as productive as I should be?</font>: Did you do what was essential for the day, and did you use the hours available for productivity well? Another way to check this is, did you do scheduled appointments, and did you work on Priorities, Intentions, and make Progress during available hours. <font color="#ff0000"><span style="background: #ffff00">This parameter is a lot fuzzier than the newer Intentions, Progress and Value tracking in Time Tracking, and perhaps it should be replaced with those or deliver what is essentially a computed judgement based on them. For example, you can compare those with the calculated hours 'available to intentional effort'. If we use a formula that is something like 'yes' if <code>max(Intentional,Progress)&gt;=min(6,0.65*available)</code> then, in addition to the direct progress measurements, this can tease out whether there are too many non-productive time intervals in a day, such as for driving, community tasks, etc. This deserves testing, and it deserves some more thought, because it might be better to just try to measure such things more directly. Now testing this formulaic approach: <code>Daily!J1068 =if(max('Time Tracking'!O865, 'Time Tracking'!P865 )&gt;=min(6,0.65*'Time Tracking'!K865),"yes","no")</code></span></font> [<span style="background: #00ff00">a</span>]
