# fzlog - Log modification utility

The `fzlog` utility is used for a variety of actions that modify the Log.

The `fzlog-cgi.py` script provides a CGI interface to fzlog for web-based
control.

This includes closing Log chunks and starting new Log chunks for a
selected Node.

E.g. `/cgi-bin/fzlog-cgi.py?action=open&n=<node-id>`
