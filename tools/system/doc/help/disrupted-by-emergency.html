<h1>Formalizer: Help: Disrupted by Emergency</h1>

<B>An urgent or emergency situation that was not anticipated or planned for, at least not in its actual and apparent form, is distrupting anticipated task time required or day schedule. On top of the urgent challenge itself, concern over the disruption and the effect on the day's measured performance is causing anxiety.</B>

    <TD>The need to deal well with urgent or emergency situations is recognized as fundamental. It is understandable, though unhelpful, that concerns over schedule and performance disruption pile on top of the actual immediate challenge.
      <OL>
	<LI>When an urgent situation demands it, don't be shy about disregarding earlier time required estimates or schedules. Just do what needs to be done. You can switch to the <a href="../../system.html#20200516103456.1">Facing Urgent or Emergency Challenges task</a>, which always: a) Earns DAF challenge reward, b) is considered an Intention task (because you always intend to make it through an emergency) aimed at the Milestone <a href="../../roadmap.html#20200516103237.1">EMERGENCY-SOLVED</a>, and c) earns a Step towards that Milestone when necessary actions are taken. (In other words, it has to be possible to deal with urgent emergencies as needed without being inhibited by worries about scores.)
	<LI>If the situation results in major changes to your daily routine then you get to practice another set of target behaviors that are aimed at being able to make adjustments and at quickly getting back to making personal progress. (More detailing is probably needed here and will be learned when the situation arises.)
