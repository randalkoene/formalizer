<h1>Formalizer: Help: AL Crammed with Tasks</h1>

<B>The AL (of the next day/days) looks crammed with fixed tasks that don't leave room for the variable target date tasks that should actually be prioritized.</B>

<P>
  
<TABLE>

  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>Pressure test tasks by engaging with them:
      <OL>
	<LI>Cycle through the upcoming tasks that are competing for time, and do so quickly (e.g. one 20 minute Task Chunk each).
	<LI>During that 20 minute engagement, learn about the actual urgency and needs of the task.
	<LI>Reschedule accordingly.
      </OL>
    </TD>
    <TD>This is related to a run-through, but more engaged, since actual Task output may be produced.</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>2</TD>
    <TD>It is likely that there are a number of tasks with fixed target dates that should really have variable target dates.</TD>
    <TD></TD>

  <TR>
    <TD>3</TD>
    <TD>No matter how many things there are to do, there is only one sensible priority order (setting aside odering between equally prioritized tasks, which shouldn't matter if they truly have equal priority), and there is only so much you can do in each day. If necessary, you can take a short-hand of the tasks out of the AL and put them into a spreadsheet where you can easily move rows up and down. Then schedule in the AL accordingly.</TD>
    <TD></TD>

  <TR>
    <TD>4</TD>
    <TD>If the urgency demands it, then remove regular, periodic, and even System tasks from the day's schedule by skipping them forward to the next iteration.</TD>

    <TD>Seek to reduce the time required for tasks through aggressive Triage.</TD>

  <TR>
    <TD>6</TD>
    <TD>If the urgency demands it and if there is absolutely no other way then do what you must to cut down on sleep hours and create additional cramming hours.</TD>
