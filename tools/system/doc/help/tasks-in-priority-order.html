<h1>Formalizer: Help: Dealing with Tasks in Sensible Priority Order</h1>

<B>I'm not dealing with tasks in the sensible priority order.</B>

<P>
  
<TABLE>

  <TR>
    <TD>1</TD>
    <TD>Work priority tasks in the order presented in the AL. This is still a test, but so far the results seem good. No random chunk picking there. Manually insure this. After the first AL update, go in and make sure that priority (income earning) tasks are sorted correctly for the most interesting, most likely to work out and be relevant at this moment in time are up front.</TD>
    <TD><a href="../../../System/Notes-on-Change-v1.0/NotesonChangev1.0.html#id.xz6mx28pc0h1">System Summary: Action: Task Selection</a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LeVD95TeBv_3QNby-Robe_BXS20g3WJEO3udy9mIb8I/edit#gid=1839706421&range=N1:N2">Time Tracking: First Intentional</a></TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>2</TD>
    <TD>Unless a fixed target date task is ‘due’, do variable target date tasks, so that they get time. (This almost treats fixed target date tasks as exact target date tasks, but is really a stopgap to give variable target date tasks that are priorities time early in the day.) (This is an experiment.)</TD>

  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>3</TD>
    <TD>Keep updating <B>Progress Metrics throughout the day</B> to note explicitly that important things are getting done. This includes measurements of Intentions time, Progress, DAFs handled, and Criteria Points towards the next Checkpoint or Milestone.</TD>
    <TD><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LeVD95TeBv_3QNby-Robe_BXS20g3WJEO3udy9mIb8I/edit#gid=964163666">Points Testing</a>; SYSTEM USE (e.g. as in <a href="../../../lists.html">lists.html</a>)</TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>4</TD>
    <TD>As per Time Tracking, insure that:
      <OL>
	<LI>The first intentional was a priority. The first intentional task carried out (not breakfast) should be the highest priority task. This is meant to avoid the situation of productive procrastination where all sorts of other intended tasks are worked on but not the highest priority task.
	<LI>Non-priorities take a maximum of 30 percent of available time. Non-priority intentionals should consume a maximum of 30 percent of time worked on intentionals during the day. (More detailed are in the comment in the Time Tracking sheet.)</TD>
