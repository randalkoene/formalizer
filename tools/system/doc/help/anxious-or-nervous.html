      Take a moment to carry out micro-meditation. Remove your personal monologue and self-oriented perspective. Acknowledge that your Values show that you wish most to have lasting impact that extends beyond self. Therefore, your actions are aimed at outcomes for all and for your kids. Keep that in mind. Then, personal Challenegs or emotions about having to ask or reach out mean little.
