<h1>Formalizer: Help: Difficulty with Emotions</h1>

<B>I'm having difficulties with emotions. They may be overwhelming, or they may be coming at a very inconvenient time, or I may have time to properly deal with them.</B>

      It is normal to have different emotions, and sometimes those emotions can arrive unexpectedly or powerfully. If there is time and space to give proper attention to the emotion then it may be worth assigning that time and doing the processing work that is needed.

    <TD>
      When processing emotions, try to avoid elevating them beyond their deserved presence. You don't want to cause yourself to hold on to it unnecessarily, or to keep revisitng the emotions in a way that gets in the way.

      Overwhelming emotions may be dealt with in some of these ways:
      <UL>
	<LI>Meditate to clear the mind and focus on the present.
	<LI>Apply a counter-acting chemical. For example, to counter-act a down mood take an upper.
	<LI>Fresh air and exercise can help.
	<LI>A shower can help.
