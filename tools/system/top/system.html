<h2>Ideal Situation</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>
Current best understanding of my <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?n=20190306192914.1&G=true&T=true&B=79&tdorder=true&tdbad=true&tdfar=true&N=7.0&O=later','_blank');">IDEAL-SITUATION</button>. Expressed as Milestones.
</p></li>
<li><p>
A regular process to review my Ideal Situation.
</p></li>
<li><p>
A planned <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?n=20201107064029.1&G=true&T=true&C=300&B=79&tdorder=true&tdbad=true&tdfar=true','_blank');">Milestone</button>
and <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzlink.py?id=20200812080307.1&alt=histfull','_blank');">Activity</button>
process for the next further improvement of my Ideal Situation insight.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Phase Threads</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>
At any point in time, I am in a <b>phase</b> that is characterized by having some subset of priority Milestones. Those Milestones are either in the Ideal Situation set or dependencies thereof. These are presented in the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?D=threads&T=true&u=204512311159&r=100&U=true','_blank');">Threads</button> board.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The point of this is to not spread my focus to thinly, to take sensible turns for focus.
</p></li>
<li><p>
A sensible order of activities based on the dependencies hierarchy <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzvismilestones-cgi.py','_blank');">Graph</button> prioritizes Phase threads in the <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzgraphhtml-cgi.py','_blank');">Activities Schedule</button>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The scheduling order is regularly corrected to align with the dependencies hierarchy by using the <b>Apply TD Changes</b> feature on Node Boards.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Schedule contains recognized <b>Promises</b> and <b>Challenges</b>. These are intended to be addressed during times of the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/schedule-cgi.py?c=true&num_days=7&s=20','_blank');">Calendar Days Schedule</button> when my energy and mental state are best set to do so.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress Feedback</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>
It is very important to make progress in a way that is immediately measurable and felt. For this, I select <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?D=week_main_goals&T=true&u=204512311159&r=100&U=true','_blank');">Week Goals</button> threads that can be accomplished in that amount of time.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Weekly Goals work on the Phase Threads. The Weekly Goals are <a href="/cgi-bin/fzlink.py?id=20240603105017.1" target="_blank">reviewed and updated</a> each week based on the <b>sensibly updated Schedule</b> (a week long look-ahead and update of upcoming Nodes).
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Weekly Goals threads are split to address 2 categories, presently <b>work</b> and <b>self-work</b>. At times, the split is meant to be 50/50, and self-work can be aimed almost exclusively on one thing, presently my financial situation. The intended split - or time allocation - is expressed explicitly in the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzloghtml-cgi.py?review=true','_blank');">Day review</button>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Start each day with some perspective while using the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/daywiz.py','_blank');">DayWiz</button> to guide me. Finalize and review tracked metrics of the preceding day.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Are there realizations? Priorities? New Nodes needed?
</p></li>
<li><p>
During <b>Scheduling</b>, prefer Nodes that appear in <b>Weekly Main Goals</b>. Plan, during this day, to do something externally visible (<b>add NNL here!</b>).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Frequently (re)check the order of VTD/UTD Nodes in the Schedule to ensure that it is sensible.
</p></li>

<li><p>
During the day, keep track of actual progress. At a minimum, check <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?D=week_main_goals&T=true&u=204512311159&r=100&U=true&N=7', '_blank');">progress bars</button> during the <a href="/cgi-bin/fzlink.py?id=20040402045825.1" target="_blank">second mini-day update</a>. Here, I try to identify the <b>intended distribution</b>:
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox"> I am spending time during the day in a way that will result in <b>good Day Review scores</b>. (<span style="color:red;">Needs a more flexible script for automation.</span>)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox"> I am making <b>measurable progress</b> towards Weekly Main Goals during the day. (<span style="color:red;">Needs before and now measures to compare.</span>)</li>
<li><input type="checkbox"> I am <b>balancing</b> progress in 2 categories.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

A brief reminder of new System methods that I'm still manually testing:
<UL>
<LI><input type="checkbox"> A week-long averaged spread to achieve the desired Week Goals and Categories distribution of effort. This involves picking 24 hours stretches for focus in one category or another (typically, research work vs something else). The start time and end time should be noted. For the current spread it could make sense to pick 4 days for research work and 3 days for other focus.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> Points for doing things in planned order. Updated the Schedule with this in mind.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> Points for turning on a timer when not in planned order or when trying to stick with a small amount of time.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> Making challenges more granular.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> Using meditation to put myself into a scene that clarifies why I am self-disciplined.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> Create a distribution in the Schedule that aims to score well in day review.
<LI><input type="checkbox"> During the day, track how my time spent is working with day review time limits on categories.
</UL>
