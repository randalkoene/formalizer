<h2>Ideal Situation</h2>

<p>
Current best understanding of my <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?n=20190306192914.1&G=true&T=true&B=79&tdorder=true&tdbad=true&tdfar=true&N=7.0&O=later','_blank');">IDEAL-SITUATION</button>. Expressed as Milestones.
</p>
<p>
A regular process to review my Ideal Situation.
</p>
<p>
A planned <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?n=20201107064029.1&G=true&T=true&C=300&B=79&tdorder=true&tdbad=true&tdfar=true','_blank');">Milestone</button>
and <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzlink.py?id=20200812080307.1&alt=histfull','_blank');">Activity</button>
process for the next further improvement of my Ideal Situation insight.
</p>

<h2>Phase Threads</h2>

<p>
At any point in time, I am in a <b>phase</b> that is characterized by having some subset of priority Milestones. Those Milestones are either in the Ideal Situation set or dependencies thereof. These are presented in the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?D=threads&T=true&u=204512311159&r=100&U=true','_blank');">Threads</button> board.
</p>
<p>
The point of this is to not spread my focus to thinly, to take sensible turns for focus.
</p>
<p>
A sensible order of activities based on the dependencies hierarchy <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzvismilestones-cgi.py','_blank');">Graph</button> prioritizes Phase threads in the <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzgraphhtml-cgi.py','_blank');">Activities Schedule</button>.
</p>
<p>
The Schedule contains recognized <b>Promises</b> and <b>Challenges</b>. These are intended to be addressed during times of the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/schedule-cgi.py?c=true&num_days=7&s=20','_blank');">Calendar Days Schedule</button> when my energy and mental state are best set to do so.
</p>

<h2>Progress Feedback</h2>

<p>
It is very important to make progress in a way that is immediately measurable and felt. For this, I select <button class="button button2" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/nodeboard-cgi.py?D=week_main_goals&T=true&u=204512311159&r=100&U=true','_blank');">Week Goals</button> threads that can be accomplished in that amount of time.
</p>
<p>
The Weekly Goals work on the Phase Threads. The Weekly Goals are <a href="/cgi-bin/fzlink.py?id=20240603105017.1" target="_blank">reviewed and updated</a> each week based on the sensibly updated Schedule.
</p>
<p>
The Weekly Goals threads are split to address 2 categories, presently <b>work</b> and <b>self-work</b>. At times, the split is meant to be 50/50, and self-work can be aimed almost exclusively on one thing, presently my financial situation. The intended split - or time allocation - is expressed explicitly in the <button class="button button1" onclick="window.open('/cgi-bin/fzloghtml-cgi.py?review=true','_blank');">Day review</button>.
</p>

<p>
tracking progress and sticking to the intended distribution through the day
