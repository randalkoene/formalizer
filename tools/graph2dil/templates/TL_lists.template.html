<H1><A NAME="AL">Active Lists (AL)</A></H1>

Active lists are generated according to ongoing <A HREF="planning/material.html#article-writing-tips">projects</A> and agendas, utilizing relevance, urgency and deadline information to establish prioretization, and displaying those items with a priority great enough to be kept in mind and subsequently attended to. Projects refer to specific DIL entries, and involve the completion of that entry and all its dependencies (but also see <B><a href="lists/task-log.20110126.html#201102200557.2">The Relationship between Projects and DIL entries</a></B>). it is a good habit to always check the generated schedule for the next day or week, to assure that it is sensible. For satisfying achievements the ALs should be followed with discipline, to ensure that all relevant tasks are completed prior to their original target dates.

To make sure that each important task is done by its necessary target date, planning needs to take into account:
<BR>
a.) The current situation. Immediate need and best actions. This part of planning explains the actions and their value with confidence.
<BR>
b.) The big picture from the top level down. What to do to reach the ultimate Objectives. This part of planning gives an overriding perspective and it is the context for what is done.
<BR>
The balanced combination of both parts of planning explains and proposes activities and strategies.
<BR>
One set of tools with which to balance both parts of planning are the <a href="../../tmp/significant.html" ><B>significant.html</B></a> and <a href="../../tmp/metrics.html" >metrics.html</a> files.

<H1><A NAME="TL">Task Logs (TL)</A></H1>

The Task Log is a short, but complete, point-wise record of results with references to more elborate documentation. The temporal continuity of the Task Log retains the context within which results were obtained. The Task Log is designed for completeness and filtered extraction of information, which can subsequently be browsed, included in articles or used for Detail Item Lists and for further tasks. (Also see <A HREF="work-log.html#task-logs">the description in the Work Log</A>.)

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><TR><TD>
<U>Hypothesis</U>: Working in parallel on the totality of things to be accomplished has a positive effect (a) on <b>my work</b> and (b) on <b>the results</b>. My work does not bog down. Sufficient attention is given to all aspects of the overall set of objectives (which is also where the scheduling method interacts with <a href="planning/goal-directed-decision-making.html">goal directed decision making</a>). I gain motivation by a perspective of the whole. The results of my work are improved by the effects of interaction between tasks.
<P>
<U>Method</U>: There are three main components of the current method, namely (1) striving for hierarchy in which efficient work is aided by a clear and concrete subdivision into smaller tasks on which a superior task depends, (2) defining an ideal order in which tasks should be completed (for which target dates without tags are simply one implementation, where it is normally a good idea to specify such order for the more superior tasks that automatically propagate the order to their dependencies), and (3) a necessary grounding in real-world schedules (which impose the fixed "F" class of target dates, as well as their derivatives, such as specific "S" target dates).
<P>
A good example of hierarchy is given by the <a href="/cgi-bin/dil2al?dil2al=D&DILIDCHKBX20050216063846.1=extract&processcmd=newhierarchy&maxdepth=5&setpar__EQ__hierarchyexcerptlength=80&setpar=noreversehierarchy">CASPAN tasks</a>, and an example of consequent results is therefore given by the results (and the timing of such results) for the CASPAN tasks.

Guideline IDs are organized into categories according to the sort of tasks that they apply to. All IDs begin with a lower-case ``g'' to distinguish guideline IDs from other IDs (e.g. Novelty IDs, @CRef@ tags, etc.). The category indicator can be followed by an ID number or another classification identifier with ID number for specialized categories. When a visible marker is included at the onset of the guideline, it is encased in a structure, as in the following example: &lt;A NAME="gL1"&gt;&lt;!-- @guideline@ --&gt;gL1&lt;/A&gt; (the NAME tag should be included, even if the original document is not HTML), which can optionally include extra style tags and surrounding characters, such as [&lt;B&gt;&lt;A NAME="gL1"&gt;&lt;!-- @guideline@ --&gt;gL1&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt;].

<B>Update 20040417</B>: A focus on the production of tangible OUTPUT seems to reduce time spent bogged down. Note that output is not equal to task completion, since completion includes details that are often more easily taken care of once tangible output has already been produced. When task results are intended to be presented or delivered to others it is a simple matter to define what constitutes the output to focus on. There must be a similar definition of tangible output for work on other tasks.

<LI><B>It is not necessary to optimize and perfect every detail</B>. It is perfectly legitimate to improve one's model in an ensuing paper. (E.g.

<LI>If you spend more than <B>2 twenty minute chunks</B> of time <B>more</B> on an item than predicted, consider how to move on by rescheduling specific DILs for later so that priority items can be dealt with now.
<LI>Similarly, if you have spent <B> 3 twenty minute chunks</B> on the investigation of a model assumption, consider scheduling specific DILs to continue the investigation at a later time, and make a working assumption in order to move on now.
<LI>If the <B>time required</B> indicated for a particular DIL entry seems low for a complete treatment of the subject matter described in the content it implies that an exploratory (not detailed) treatment is expected. This can lead to initial outlines of and notes about processes, models, etc. More focused DILs are then created.

[<B><A NAME="gPP5"><!-- @guideline@ -->gPP5</A></B>]Within a project track chosen based on fundamental research goals, structure the research around well-defined papers. Then produce research as required for each paper, and do writing and experimenting in an interleaved simultaneous fashion. On occasion there is reason to do additional experiments beyond the requirements of the papers.

See <A HREF="lists/task-log.20000417.html#200009211300.2">TL#200009211300.2</A>, also known as paper planning guideline <A HREF="lists/task-log.20000417.html#gPP4">gPP4</A>.

<H1><A NAME="experiment-plan">Experimentation Hints</A></H1>

<U>Choosing Experiments:</U>

Which way around are experiments and objectives established? Do we have a set of research objectives, and select appropriate experiments to achieve them? Or do we have a set of experiments with which research was conducted, and note objectives accordingly in the papers?<BR>
[<B><A NAME="gE1"><!-- @guideline@ -->gE1</A></B>]<B>Goal oriented work: Have objectives, seek to achieve them, do experiments for that purpose.</B> Ideally, set up specific hypotheses and test them.<BR>
Other experiments may well be described as possibly interesting in DIL entries. But the location of an experiment's DIL entry within the DIL hierarchy indicates what objectives it relates to, so that relevant experiments are scheduled as a priority.

<U>Scheduling Experiments:</U>
<OL>
<LI>[<B><A NAME="gE2"><!-- @guideline@ -->gE2</A></B>]It is possible to do the initial scheduling of many experiments at once so as to get a good idea of the schedule requirements.
<LI>[<B><A NAME="gE3"><!-- @guideline@ -->gE3</A></B>]Plan at successive resolutions:
<OL>
<LI>[DIL] Select experiments according to the requirements of objectives (see Guideline above), prune other experiment ideas by retaining them in the DILs for later. This can involve identifying and sorting existing experiment ideas to schedule as well as adding remaining experiments necessary to achieve the objectives.
<LI>[DIL] Initial specification of the experiments, indicating the corresponding objective, hypothesis and method. Set target dates at this point.
<LI>[DIL] Specify implementation requirements (DIL with TD), when to fulfill them (DIL with TD), when to run the next experiment (DIL with TD) and when to evaluate the results (DIL with TD)
</OL>
These tasks 1 to 3 can be scheduled in parallel.
</OL>

<U>Logging Experiments:</U>

It is general practise to keep a logbook when doing experiments, and the <A HREF="lists/task-log.html">Task Log</A> is clearly a logbook. While it is possible to log the actual data and results to a separate experiment-specific document, some time is required to set up directories, references to and formats for such documents. It is quite possible to generate such documents on demand (in addition to the material that is collected in a paper) by extracting the sequence of Task Log entries linked to an experiment DIL entry. As stated above, the convention is that a Task Log is ``a short, but complete, point-wise record of results with references to more elaborate documentation''. That elaborate documentation can mean graphs, tables, data input and output, permanently linked documents for collected results, models and standards, as well as papers.


<H1><A NAME="templates-parsing-autogeneration">Templates, automatic parsing and draft generation</A></H1>

<UL>
<LI>Use templates instead of macros to avoid dependence on a particular editor.
<LI>The approach: use <B>template to specify structure and special information</B> that can be provided, use <B>standard structure and information when parsing</B> with dil2al tools to <B>generate desired resulting drafts</B>, possibly including more templates. For example:<BR>
(a) When programming, use templates to initialize classes and functions of GESN components, enter information where requested, information is used to determine if and how to diagnose the function, diagnostic function is automatically created, requiring only minimal editing.<BR>
(b) Similarly for papers, templates are used during making of notes, the notes are parsed to generate a paper plan, the edited paper plan is parsed to update the notes and to generate a paper draft using templates, the generated paper draft offers comments and suggestions for efficient editing of the paper.

At this point, calculations can continue in triplicate if T is available in the form of minimum, maximum and average estimates, based on experience with other items, which of course depends on what sort of work is involved: obtaining information, designing structure, implementation, etc.<BR>
Time required always refers to time spent properly dealing with an item according to its content. That can mean working on an item, if its content is itself a task to be completed. Or it can mean considering the item and writing up more detailed information that might again lead to detail items. Or it can mean arranging and planning an item, perhaps by creating a process that will insure that corresponding detail items will be added as required. E.g. An item stating ``content in the task logs should be collected into articles'' could lead to the development of a process that insures that task log content is automatically filtered for article content, and that detail items appear for the writing of the articles. The time required therefore does not necessarily indicate the time needed to complete work on everything mentioned in the content, but rather the time needed to deal with the item so that results are generated that propagate information (to document specific results, or lead to other detailed items). If, for instance, a detail item is a reference to a specific neuronal component or process, dealing with it can imply obtaining significant information from the reference, extracting functional specifics, evaluating the component or process, and generating goals directed new detail items.

	<LI>Multiplication by R_{proj} gives the project-specific item valuation. We favour single valuable items over multiple items of the same combined value: (R_{proj}*V)^n, where n=1.1, 1.5 or 2.0. Results with <A HREF="../../octave/dil2al.m">dil2al.m</A> show that for a desired combined T_{req} at 70% of the single item T_{req} for two items, each of which have half the valuation of the single item, n=1.5 is suitable.

The ratio of valuation over time can lead to quick and correct decisions on inclusion or postponement. The decision-making process can be improved through adjustments based on the results of prior decisions.<BR>

A threshold on the number of chunks to display is used to generate the visible Active List, while the complete Active List is generated from all items with priority values greater than 0. <B>(The visible and complete ALs are being converted into ``wide'' and ``focused'' selections from the complete AL. This is done, since it is possible to compute complete ALs for a very large number of task chunks, and all task chunks are listed in the order that is computed. The complete AL is not displayed, but recomputed when necessary.)</B> That list is kept in a short-hand format, with chunks assigned so that the lowest priority item has one chunk. The visible list is generated through randomized selection with a probability distribution according to the chunk frequencies in the top p_{visselect} portion (tunable, e.g. p_{visselect}=0.9) of the range of priorities in the full Active List. Each time an Active List chunk is checked off (by being worked on), one chunk is subtracted from the corresponding item in the full Active List. Extraction of another visible list from the full list is done if requested manually or if only a portion p_{vislist} of the visible list remains to be done (p_{vislist} is a tunable parameter). Generation of another full Active List occurs when requested manually, or whenever there is a change in the DIL and the new, altered or removed items have a computed priority in the upper m_{priority} percent (where m_{priority} is a tunable parameter) of the previously computed list of priorities, or if there have been changes in the DIL since the last AL generation (but not of highest priority) and a portion p_{AL} (which is also a tunable parameter) of the full Active List has been worked on, or if a specified time T_{regenerate} (a tunable parameter) has passed since the last generation of a full Active List.<P>
(Selection: Order from top priority down, generate #chunks random numbers, multiply by [#chunks:-1:1], take floor values and add one.)
<P>
If an item so far has R_{proj}=0, but appears to be valuable (V), eventhough its inclusion would expand the context of the project, then inclusion can be brought about by altering the project theme description so that related topic keywords (which may also be updated) occur.
<P>
In further automation the results from previous estimates can be used to enhance the process of initial estimations. It may be that, just as with the <A HREF="../txt/economy/autonomous-behaviour.txt">autonomous behaviour</A> of characters in <A HREF="../txt/economy/earthstory.html">Earth</A>, a neuronal network approach may provide the most successful implementation for such a dynamic planning and scheduling method, involving relevance based on keyword identification, and learning of initial value estimates and functions of parameters from the results of previous decisions. I can make a network that at first only learns from my and the simple automated activities. The network would receive as many possibly relevant inputs as possible, such as key words to identify, item contents, logged results (possibly beyond the recursion into new detail items that exists anyway), and all data I use to make decisions for initial values set by hand. From that the network can learn to deduce and enhance the automated estimation procedures, and possibly also a satisfactory and reliable method for initial value selection.

<B><U>Available Time Assumed by AL:</U></B>
<UL>
<LI>AL generation can be requested specifically for a number of chunks, or up to a specific date. A complete AL is created when ``0'' is specified, this specification overrides all others. The default is to create an AL with ``generatealtcs'' chunks, where every day is considered to have ``algenregular'' hours, and time chunks of size ``timechunksize'' minutes each. The default values can be modified in the configuration file, <A HREF="../../.dil2alrc">.dil2alrc</A>, and are otherwise set to the compile-time values DEFAULTALTCS, DEFAULTALGENREGULAR, and DEFAULTCHUNKSIZE respectively. If a complete AL is created, then the default hours per day are ``algenall'', with compile-time value DEFAULTALGENALL.
<LI>DIL entries can contain a specific parameter for the number of hours per day that is assumed for the type of task. (???Can either search up from superior to find parameter, with the default values if parameter is not found, or can take the largest number in all dependencies.???)
<LI>Tasks whose target dates are later than the current date, but that require more task chunks than remain available before that target date, cause the number of hours per day to expand automatically to the nearest amount that allows the target date to be achieved, to a maximum of 24 hours per day. A warning indicates this expansion. The AL is regenerated until all tasks can be achieved by their target dates, or until the 24 hours per day setting. Another warning is given for tasks that cannot achieve their target dates.
<LI>Automatic expansion of the number of hours per day for additional time to enable a target date to be achieved is not done, only if the option 'S' is appended to the AL request (e.g. dil2al -AS, dil2al -AS0, etc.), to indicate strict planning according to hours given by algenregular, algenall and AL superior parameters.
<LI>AL generation can make a number of different assumptions about the number of hours that have already been worked during the current day: (a) use the ``alworkdaystart'' parameter to estimate time worked, (b) add up logged task chunks during this day to estimate time worked, (c) obtain the time worked on the command line, or (d) ask for the time worked.
<LI>Target dates with only year, month and day indications receive the default time 00:00 (midnight).
