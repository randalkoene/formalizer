# Miscellaneous Prototypes for Testing

A collection of (mostly tiny) prototypes developed for testing purposes. These are not formally part of the Formalizer core or tools module structure.

## How to use these

1. Copy the executable scripts to the CGI directory (typically `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/`).
2. Copy the `.html` files to a web-visible directory (e.g. `/var/www/html/formalizer/`).
