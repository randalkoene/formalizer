# addnode - command line interface to fzgraph

This command line tool facilitates adding Nodes, Edges and Topics.
Interactive prompts, a text editor, and a browser are used to collect the
necessary information, and `fzgraph` is called to create the Node, Edge,
or Topic.

For the web interface to fzgraph, see `fzaddnode-CGI.py` or `addnode-form`.

Note: This is the Formalizer 2.x successor to the Formalizer 1.x `dilentry` tool.
