# boilerplate - Quickly prepare standardized Formalizer source code

The `boilerplate` tool facilitates Formalizer development work by simplifying the rapid generation of standardized source code stubs, while adhering to up-to-date Formalizer standards. Using `boilerplate` helps to ensure those standards are applied.

The same `boilerplate` tool is used to generate stubs for multiple languages by specifying `c++`, `python`, etc.
