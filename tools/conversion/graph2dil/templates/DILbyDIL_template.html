    This list contains references to all detail items that are parsed for active task lists, ordered by their creation ID, with a set of references to related topics (i.e. indicating topical detailed items lists that the item occurs in). The items are given relevance values with regards to the referenced topics in brackets, R_{top} in [0,1] (see <A HREF="../lists.html#DIL2AL">manual and automatic derivation procedures</A>). Project-specific item relevances are shown in the third column, R_{proj} in [0,1] (see <A HREF="../lists.html#DIL2AL">manual and automatic derivation procedures</A>), followed by unbounded Importance of an item to a project, and Importance bounded to the interval [0,1]. The fourth number indicated with an AL is the item's deadline prior to the project target date (if there is none, or the target date falls beyond the project target date that is indicated by `-'). This is followed by the item's urgency, as computed from its target date and that of the project, and the item Priority as derived from its Importance and Urgency. A <B>fixed</B> target date can be indicated by prepending an `F'.
