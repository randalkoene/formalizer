<   <TD COLSPAN=2>The present way of identifying what belongs to Intentions vs Infrastructure (etc) is pretty rough around the edges. It makes assumptions about the contents of entire DIL files, while tasks may well be accidentally misplaced. Exceptions can be made, but that requires manually editing .rc files. This could be improved by a) detecting if tasks are dependencies of Active Milestones, instead of judging them based on DIL file membership, or b) using direct tags (INTENTION,INFRASRUCTURE, etc). If those can be added easily then it could replace many of the assumptions. It could also be good if, instead of deriving the Time Tracking variables from the ones declared in the .rc file, if there was a separate .rc file specifically for Time Tracking metrics calculation. But then again, that may become unnecessary if we switch from the reduced set Time Tracking to a more granular set, as in the superior of this task.

Meanwhile, the Focused and Wide AL output is already curtailed by different parameters and much shorter than anything that is seen about the other Tmaxtime or numtcs constraints! None of that made much difference at all.

< This list contains references to all detail items that are parsed for active task lists, ordered by their creation ID, with a set of references to related topics (i.e. indicating topical detailed items lists that the item occurs in). The items are given relevance values with regards to the referenced topics in brackets, R_{top} in [0,1] (see <A HREF="../lists.html#DIL2AL">manual and automatic derivation procedures</A>). Project-specific item relevances are shown in the third column, R_{proj} in [0,1] (see <A HREF="../lists.html#DIL2AL">manual and automatic derivation procedures</A>), followed by unbounded Importance of an item to a project, and Importance bounded to the interval [0,1]. The fourth number indicated with an AL is the item's deadline prior to the project target date (if there is none, or the target date falls beyond the project target date that is indicated by `-'). This is followed by the item's urgency, as computed from its target date and that of the project, and the item Priority as derived from its Importance and Urgency. A <B>fixed</B> target date can be indicated by prepending an `F'.

The first thing in calling for parameters is then not to jump to cache reading, but rather to check the global object and see if it is out of date compared to the file. If it is still valid then simply refer to it again.

<   <TD COLSPAN=2>It looks like alcomp.cc:Active_List::Initialize_AL_Length() <b>never</b> listens to a Tmaxtime command modifier for AL generation. In the dil2al.cc code that reads the modifiers, it will read only either the Tmaxtime or numtcs modifier, and the Tmaxtime modifier overrides. At that point generatealtcs keeps its original value, which was initialized as 3*3*12=108. Normally Tmaxtime is not set, so then generatealtcs is read (normally 0) from the command modifier (typically 0). Then, in the Initialize_AL_Length() function, if generatealtcs==0, then allength is set to totreq (and generatealtcs updated to that value as well). Alternatively, if generatealtcs was non-zero (e.g. the default 108, which is also kept if Tmaxtime was specified), then something else happens... going through it again, I'm getting even more confused.

< <TD COLSPAN=2>Show <B>paired-pulse inhibition</B> of population spikes (and facilitation by means of GABA inhibition) in the hippocampus, as described in [<A HREF="../planning/bibliography.html#MARG:GABA">MARG:GABA</A>]. This involves the addition of <B>paired-pulse facilitation</B> phenomena on inhibitory connections. Extensive interneuronal recurrent connections are highly seizure-prone, making for conspicuous paired-pulse effects in CA3. In comparison, dentate gyrus perforant path stimulation should cause little, if any, paired-pulse inhibition. Paragraph 1 on page 73 of [<A HREF="../planning/bibliography.html#MARG:GABA">MARG:GABA</A>] describes attributes of the paired-pulse inhibition phenomenon that are specific to the hippocampal network with its tight GABAergic control of CA3 pyramidal neurons. This refers to Tsodyks' analysis in [<A HREF="../planning/bibliography.html#TSO:HIPP">TSO:HIPP</A>].

> <TD COLSPAN=2>Decouple things in the Formalizer: For progress with the usability, interfaces, and ultimately the rewrite of the Formalizer, one of the big problems right now is that you always have to decide a) freely work with any language/interpreter to build the new/improved bit but sacrifice ease of access to data structures, or b) build everything into the monolithic dil2al for ease of access to data structures. That is the core problem to solve in order to begin easily playing with both enhancement and rewrite.

<   <TD COLSPAN=2>With a good database query tool that can find details in the Task Log it becomes possible to write relatively simple rules that automatically detect most (or all) of the metrics being collected. It seems that a prerequisite for this is to have all the data accessible (i.e. metrics collection and logging are both happening in the same account). There are a few options for how to do this:

Also, the Flags and Victories columns will only be properly tallied if a) they are related directly to a fast and clear review of the previous day where avoidance relates to originally planned AL Day tasks and victories relates to TL entries, and b) their scores have a meaningful impact that is shown.

For example, go about requesting an adjustment of the support agreements, decide what I wish the agreements to be like (e.g. the support I wish to give Amelia and Seyrena,  as well as Sophia). Also, decide on some heuristics in terms of entanglements I do or do not wish to get into from here on out, e.g. marriage, children, credit cards, mortgages, etc. None of those things are necessarily right or wrong, but there are conditions where they are either a good or bad deal.
