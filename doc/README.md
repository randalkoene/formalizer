# Formalizer source code documentation

This `doc` directory is intended for documentation used in the development of
Formalizer software. The majority of this documentation is generated by Doxygen.

For documentation about using Formalizer programs, about the System, and about
other topics, see the Documentation entry point on the top dashboard.

The [manual](./manual/manual.md) that is in this directory is also linked from there. This manual
may be converted into an mkdocs site.

Also see [installation notes](./installation.md).
