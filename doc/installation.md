# Installation Notes

## Interference by browser extensions

Browser extensions that examine or filter http calls may interfere with or
slow down Formalizer web operation. If certain pages appear to open very
slowly, add the Formalizer server address(es) to the white list of the
extension involved (e.g. uBlock Origin Lite). For example:

```
localhost
127.0.0.1
```
