# Formalizer

A framework with data structure, tools, and protocols that together support a personalized System process and formal structure that evolves to *optimize the achievement of personal Value-based meaningful activity and accomplishments*.

The *Formalizer* environment provides support to a personalized *System*, applying a high degree of modularity and long-term sustainablity by separating concerns into database, data server and tools layers, each of which can be augmented or replaced while maintaining all operations.

Within each layer, the Formalizer contains many task specific programs, scripts, file formats, conventions, procedures and methods. The formal structure and process include explicit metrics and rationale, which are continually scrutinized and improved.

The principles behind this Formalizer and its earlier iterations have a documented multi-decade history. They are, nevertheless, still and always subject to further development.

### System

The System involves:

- Discoverying personal Values.
- Deriving from that long-term Ideal Situations and near-term Improved Situations.
- Mapping a personal Roadmap.
- Identifying possible Paths and path components between Milestones in that Roadmap.
- Personal behavioral and psychological analysis with consequent cognitive tools.
- Personal metrics and real-world metrics (to keep you honest!).
- Extensive support for Planning and the expression of Task hierarchies.
- Integration with Scheduling.
- Highly customizable Automated Schedule Updating (based on real world impact on plans).
- Integrated Logging (task status, experience tracking, data and documents).
- Dashboards with rapid insights.
- Everything is integrated in a connected graph (based on Event System concepts).
- Explicit check-in, and ongoing iterative updating, improvement of each process listed.

This list is merely a one second peek behind the curtain, and not meant as an introduction. Please refer to the
System documentation.
