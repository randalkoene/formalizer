# Formalizer

The Formalizer refers to a framework comprising multiple programs, scripts, file formats, conventions, procedures and methods. Together, they aim to apply an explicit formal structure and process in order to accomplish the objective of *assured optimized satisfying personally meaningful activity and achievements*. The explicit formal structure and process include metrics and rationale, and they are themselves also further scrutinized and improved.

As mentioned in documentation, the Formalizer has a multi-decade history and has undergone several iterations of development.
