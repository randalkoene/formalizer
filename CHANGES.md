- Adding fzbackup-ensure.sh script to combine mirroring to
  github and copying of DayWiz JSON data in a single command.
- Created a safety backup ~/src/formalizer-20230624.tar.gz and
  pushed updated git commit on branch dailyuseful. (It has been
  a long time since the last push, and the safety backup provides
  some assurance that things don't get messed up.)
